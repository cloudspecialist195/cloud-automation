Project:
Creatiing Folders/Files in CLI Tool and Recursive File Tree Created in Python

What It Does:
1. Creating folders and files with basic commands in CLI tool.
2. Creating folder structures/tree by using Python codes and viewing in CLI tool.

Think:
"tree" command in CLI but was built from scratch in Python. Useful for learning recursion.


How to Run It:

1. Clone the repo (hosted by GitHub) to local computer
```Git bash
git clone https://github.com/cloudspecialist195/cloud-automation.git

2. Create and navigate to the project folder
mkdir cloud-automation
cd cloud-automation
mkdir week01_basics
cd week01_basics
touch basics.py
touch file_play.py
touch README.md
touch .gitignore

3. In VS Code, use:
indent, "├── ", "│   ", and recursive function os.listdir, os.path.join, os.isdir to create tree
